  Iodinated contrast agent (ICA)-induced acute kidney injury (AKI) following acute coronary syndrome (ACS) is a frequent complication, which may lead to chronic kidney disease and increased mortality. Optical coherence tomography angiography (OCT-A) of the retina is new tool delivering a rapid and noninvasive assessment of systemic microvascularization, which is potentially involved in the occurrence of ICA-induced AKI. Between October 2016 and March 2017, 452 ACS patients were admitted to our cardiac intensive care unit. OCT-A was performed within 48 h after the ICA injection. Patients with a history of retinal disease were excluded. The patients included were divided into two groups depending on whether or not AKI occurred after injection of ICA, according to KDIGO criteria. Of the 216 patients included, 21 (10%) presented AKI. AKI was significantly associated with age, Mehran score, GRACE score, and NT-proBNP. AKI patients had significantly lower retinal vascular density (RVD)) and had more frequent low RVD (81% vs 45%, P = 0.002). Adding low RVD to the Mehran score and the NT-proBNP, or to the GRACE score and the NT-proBNP, significantly improved their predictive values, suggesting that systemic microvascular involvement remains incompletely addressed by either standard risk scores or factors known to be associated with ICA-induced AKI.
