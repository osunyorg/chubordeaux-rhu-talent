  PURPOSE. To evaluate the association between retinal microvasculature (vascular density) on optical coherence tomography-angiography (OCT-A) and the cardiovascular profile of patients hospitalized for acute coronary syndrome (ACS). METHODS. EYE-Myocardial Infarction (EYE-MI) study is a prospective cross-sectional study in the Cardiology Intensive Care Unit of Dijon University Hospital. Retinal OCT-A was performed for each patient within 2 days after admission. Superficial retinal capillary plexus (SCP) vascular density was measured. The population was divided into tertiles according to OCT-A data. RESULTS. Overall, 237 cases were retained for analysis. Patients in the tertile with the lowest retinal vascular density (RVD) were older, and more frequently had systemic hypertension and diabetes. Moreover, American Heart Association (AHA) risk and Global Registry of Acute Coronary Events (GRACE) scores were higher and left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) was lower in these patients. In multivariate analysis, the AHA risk score (odds ratio [OR], 1.06; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.04–1.09; P &lt; 0.001) and LVEF (OR, 0.95; 95% CI, 0.93–0.98; P ¼ 0.001) were significantly associated with the lowest tertile of RVD. The association between RVD and a high-risk cardiovascular profile was confirmed by a moderate correlation with the GRACE scores (Spearman r ¼ _0.33, P &lt; 0.001). CONCLUSIONS. SCP density measured on OCT-A was associated with the cardiovascular risk profile and with impaired LVEF in patients with a high-risk cardiovascular status. In the future, quantitative retinal microvascular data could be considered a good surrogate of the cardiovascular risk profile and could improve cardiovascular risk assessments.
