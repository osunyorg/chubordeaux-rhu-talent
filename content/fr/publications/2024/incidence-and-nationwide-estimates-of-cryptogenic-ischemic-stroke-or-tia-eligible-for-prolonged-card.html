  Introduction: Current guidelines indicate prolonged cardiac rhythm monitoring for atrial fibrillation screening in patients with cryptogenic ischemic stroke (IS) or transient ischemic attack (TIA). This study aimed to assess the incidence of cryptogenic IS/TIA eligible for such investigation, and to estimate the number of patients potentially concerned in whole France annually. Methods: All cryptogenic acute IS/TIA cases ⩾35 years old were retrieved from the population-based Dijon Stroke Registry, France (2013–2020). Patients eligible for prolonged cardiac rhythm monitoring were defined after excluding those who died in-hospital or within the first 30 days, or with preexisting major impairment. Annual incidence rates of eligible cryptogenic IS/TIA were calculated by age groups and sex. The total number of eligible patients in France was estimated by standardization to age- and sex-specific incidence. Results: Among 2811 IS/TIA patients recorded in the Dijon Stroke Registry, 1239 had cryptogenic IS/TIA of whom 1045 were eligible for prolonged cardiac rhythm monitoring (517 IS and 528 TIA, mean age 73.6 ± 14.6 years old, 55.4% women). Crude incidence rates of eligible cryptogenic IS/TIA were 169/100,000 per year (95% CI: 159–179) in overall sexes, 83/100,000 per year (95% CI: 76–91) for IS, and 85/100,000 per year (95% CI: 78–93) for TIA. The total number of patients with cryptogenic IS/TIA eligible for prolonged cardiac rhythm monitoring in France was estimated to be 66,125 (95% CI: 65,622–66,630) for the calendar year 2022, including 32,764 (95% CI: 32,410–33,120) with IS and 33,361 (95% CI: 33,004–33,721) with TIA. Conclusions: This study demonstrated a high incidence of cryptogenic IS/TIA eligible for prolonged cardiac rhythm monitoring. Estimates at a national level pointed out the large number of patients who may require access to such atrial fibrillation screening, with attention to be paid on regarding organization of care networks and related costs.
