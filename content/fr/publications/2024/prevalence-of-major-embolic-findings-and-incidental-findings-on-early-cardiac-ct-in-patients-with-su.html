  The purpose of this study was to assess the type and prevalence of stroke and non-stroke-related findings diagnosed on early cardiac computed tomography (CT) in patients with suspected stroke. The secondary objective was to assess the clinical consequences on the management of patients with non-stroke-related conditions identified by early cardiac CT.
