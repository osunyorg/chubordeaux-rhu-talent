  Scope Perinatal nutritional disturbances may “program” an increased cardio‐metabolic risk in adulthood; however, few experimental studies have explored their effects on mature and/or old animal. This study aims to investigate the influence of postnatal overfeeding (PNOF) on cardiac function, sensitivity to ischemia‐reperfusion (I‐R) injury in vivo, glucose metabolism, and metabolic profile of pericardial adipose tissue (PAT) in young (4 months), adult (6 months), old (12 months), and very old (18 months) male mice. Methods and results Two days after birth, PNOF is induced by adjusting the litter size of C57BL/6 male mice to three pups/mother, while the normally fed (NF) control group is normalized to nine pups/mother. After weaning, all mice have free access to standard diet. Glucose/insulin tests and in vivo myocardial I‐R injury are conducted on mice aged from 2 to 12 months, while echocardiography is performed at all ages up to 18 months. PNOF mice exhibit an early and persistent 10–20% increase in body weight and a 10% decrease in left ventricular ejection fraction throughout their lifespan. In PNOF mice aged 4, 6, and 12 months, glucose intolerance and insulin resistance are observed, as well as a 27–34% increase in infarct size. This is accompanied by a higher PAT mass with increased inflammatory status. Conclusion Short‐term PNOF results in nutritional programming, inducing long‐lasting alterations in glucose metabolism and cardiac vulnerability in male mice, lasting up to 12 months.
