abstract: >-
  The invention relates to an imaging system for following at least one surgical tool (5, 6) in an operation field inside a space (1) in the body of an animal, that comprises: at least one endoscopic camera (9) for obtaining endoscopic information of the operation field; at least one ultrasound imaging device (12) for obtaining ultrasound information on the operation field; an endoscopic and ultrasound information processing device (13), characterised in that it further comprises at least three markers (15, 16, 17) to be positioned in the operation field, said markers (15, 16, 17) being mobile relative to the tool (5, 6), and each marker being adapted to be captured both by the endoscopic camera (9) and the ultrasound imaging device (12) so that the processing means (13) can match the endoscopic information and the ultrasound information.
