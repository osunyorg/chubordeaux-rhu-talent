  Background: Cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) has emerged as a reference tool for the non-invasive diagnosis of myocarditis. However, its role in follow-up (FU) after the acute event is unclear. The objectives were to assess the evolution of CMR parameters between the acute phase of infarct-like myocarditis and 12 months thereafter and to identify the predictive factors of persistent myocardial scarring at one year. Methods: All patients with infarct-like acute myocarditis confirmed by CMR were included. CMR was performed within 8 days following symptom onset, at 3 months and at one year. One-year FU included ECG, a cardiac stress test, Holter recording, biological assessments, medical history and a quality-of-life questionnaire. Patients were classified according to the presence or absence of complete recovery at one year based on the CMR evaluation. Results: A total of 174 patients were included, and 147 patients had three CMR. At one year, 79 patients (54%) exhibited persistent myocardial scarring on CMR. A multivariate analysis showed that high peak troponin at the acute phase (OR: 3.0—95%CI: 1.16–7.96—p = 0.024) and the initial extent of late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) (OR: 1.1—95%CI: 1.03–1.19—p = 0.006) were independent predictors of persistent myocardial scarring. Moreover, patients with myocardial scarring on the FU CMR were more likely to have premature ventricular contractions during the cardiac stress test (25% versus 9%, p = 0.008). Conclusion: Less than 50% of patients with infarct-like acute myocarditis showed complete recovery at one year. Although major adverse cardiac events were rare, ventricular dysrhythmias at one year were more frequent in patients with persistent myocardial scarring.
