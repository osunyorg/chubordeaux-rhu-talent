  <b>Background:</b> Connected devices are dramatically changing many aspects in health care. One such device, the virtual reality (VR) headset, has recently been shown to improve analgesia in a small sample of patients undergoing transcatheter aortic valve implantation. <b>Objective:</b> We aimed to investigate the feasibility and effectiveness of VR in patients undergoing atrial fibrillation (AF) ablation under conscious sedation. <b>Methods:</b> All patients who underwent an AF ablation with VR from March to May 2020 were included. Patients were compared to a consecutive cohort of patients who underwent AF ablation in the 3 months prior to the study. Primary efficacy was assessed by using a visual analog scale, summarizing the overall pain experienced during the ablation. <b>Results:</b> The AF cryoablation procedure with VR was performed for 48 patients (mean age 63.0, SD 10.9 years; n=16, 33.3% females). No patient refused to use the device, although 14.6% (n=7) terminated the VR session prematurely. Preparation of the VR headset took on average 78 (SD 13) seconds. Compared to the control group, the mean perceived pain, assessed with the visual analog scale, was lower in the VR group (3.5 [SD 1.5] vs 4.3 [SD 1.6]; P=.004), and comfort was higher in the VR group (7.5 [SD 1.6] vs 6.8 [SD 1.7]; P=.03). On the other hand, morphine consumption was not different between the groups. Lastly, complications, as well as procedure and fluoroscopy duration, were not different between the two groups. <b>Conclusions:</b> We found that VR was associated with a reduction in the perception of pain in patients undergoing AF ablation under conscious sedation. Our findings demonstrate that VR can be easily incorporated into the standard ablation workflow.
