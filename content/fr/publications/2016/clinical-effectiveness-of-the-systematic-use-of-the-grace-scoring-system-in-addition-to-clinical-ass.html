  We assessed the interest of systematically using the GRACE scoring system (in addition to clinical assessment) for in- hospital outcomes and bleeding complications in the management of NSTEMI compared with clinical assessments alone. Multicentre, randomized study that included 572 consecutive NSTEMI patients, randomized 1:1, into group A: clinical stratification alone and group B: clinical+ GRACE score stratification. Main outcome measures: in-hospital outcomes and bleeding complications. There was no significant difference between the two groups for baseline data or for in-hospital MACE. In multivariate analysis, only a GRACE &gt; 140 (OR: 3.5, 95 % CI: 1.8-6.6, p &lt; 0.001) and PCI (OR: 0.55, 95 % CI: 0.3-1.0; p = 0.05) were independent predictors of in-hospital MACE. The sub-analysis of group B showed that 56 patients (20 %) were given a compliance score of 0, showing that diagnostic angiography was performed later than as recommended by the guidelines. Interestingly, 91 % had a GRACE score &gt; 140, and these patients were significantly older, and were more likely to have a history of diabetes, stroke and renal failure, together with symptoms of heart failure. After multivariate analysis, the independent predictors of a lack of compliance with guideline delays were a GRACE score &gt; 140 (OR: 9.2; CI: 4.2-20.3, p &lt; 0.001) and secondary referral from a non-PCI cardiology department (OR: 2.7; CI: 1.4-5.2, p = 0.003). In a real-world setting of patients admitted with NSTEMI, the systematic use of the GRACE scoring system at admission in the PCI centre does not improve in-hospital outcomes and bleeding complications.
