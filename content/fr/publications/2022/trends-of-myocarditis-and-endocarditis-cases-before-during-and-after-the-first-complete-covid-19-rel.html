  Background. The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on hospitalization for cardiac infections is not well known. We aimed to evaluate the nationwide trends in hospital stays for myocarditis and endocarditis cases before, during and after the nationwide lockdown for the COVID-19 pandemic in France. We then aimed to describe the proportion of myocarditis and endocarditis patients with and without COVID-19 and their clinical characteristics. Methods. Hospitalized cases of cardiac infection were extracted from the French National Discharge database, which collects the medical records of all patients discharged from all public and private hospitals in France. Age, sex, and available cardiovascular risk factors were compared between stays with and without COVID-19 during the lockdown. Results. The number of myocarditis cases was 11% higher in 2020, compared to the average of the three prior years. In 2020, 439 of 3727 cases of myocarditis were associated with COVID-19. For endocarditis, there was an increase in cases by 7% in 2020 versus prior years. For endocarditis, 3% (240 of 8128 cases) of patients with endocarditis had COVID-19. For myocarditis, older age, hypertension, diabetes, obesity, and atrial fibrillation were more frequent in patients with COVID-19 than in those without. For endocarditis, only hypertension was more frequent in patients with COVID-19 than in those without. Conclusion. Our study reports an increase in hospitalizations for both myocarditis and endocarditis in 2020, possibly related to the COVID-19 pandemic. Interestingly, the trends differ according to the COVID-19 status. Knowledge of the factors associating myocarditis or endocarditis and COVID-19 may improve the quality and the type of monitoring for people with COVID-19, the identification of patients at risk of cardiac infections, and the treatment of COVID-19 patients
