  This study examines the effect of missing body surface potentials on inverse solutions, and determines if linear interpolation can regain information lost. Using simulated and experimental data, electrograms (EGMs) were reconstructed after 1) removing and 2) interpolating 'broken' signals. Results showed that losing body surface potentials over the chest can reduce inverse reconstruction accuracy. Linear interpolation did not improve, and could further deteriorate reconstruction accuracy.
