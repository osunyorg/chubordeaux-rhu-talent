    <p>Perimeter  <br>   <br>This appendix describes the general methodological concepts common to the different retrospective <br>studies that will be conducted throughout the project. We will follow the most recent guidelines for AIbased <br>prediction models in healthcare (de Hond et al. NPJ Digit Med. 2022;5(1):2.).</p>  <p> Model construction strategy, objectives  <br>   <br>Definitions and general intermediate and multivariable model construction strategies are presented in the concept appendix. Briefly, our goal is to train AI models to predict biomarkers specific to different cardioembolic stroke disease pathways. This is carried out in two different steps: <br>Develop and validate intermediate models to predict biomarkers relevant to cardioembolic pathogenic processes from resting ECG data. <br>Develop and validate a multivariable prediction model of cardioembolic stroke from resting ECG data, using the intermediate models’ outputs as predictors.</p>  <p> Study population and data preparation  <br>   <br>Training datasets will come from different sources. (main sources: CHU Bordeaux, MIMIC IV, LOOP study & Mind the Heart study databases). Data will be prepared in the following way: <br>Selection of patients based on clinical and/or ECG criteria.</p>  <p>Creation of dataset pairs: ECG + prediction target biomarker. Most biomarkers are either biology or imaging based. For this reason, the following data quality criterion have been defined:i. Temporal proximity: biomarkers acquired &gt; 3 months from the ECG are excludedii. Disease stability: datasets with significant changes in the patient’s medical condition between the acquisition of the ECG and the biomarker will be excludediii. Data quality: biomarker measurements will be reviewed by an expert when necessary. <br>Transfer of the ECGs and corresponding biomarker annotations to the TALENT DMZ (research environment) for processing</p>  <p>ECG</p>  <p> Model development  <br>   <br>For each biomarker, define clinically relevant thresholds between normal and pathological values that can be used to thoroughly measure performancea. For example, LVEF: &lt;35%, 35-50%, &gt;50% <br>Partition data into an internal development and validation set, this is done at the patient level <br>For each biomarker we will perform the following, with appropriate measures to reduce risk of overfitting :i. Train a baseline model using ECG measurements (automated) and patient demographics to predict the biomarker valueii. Train a deep neural network model using the raw ECG data to predict the biomarker valueiii. Estimation of optimism-corrected predictive performances of each model using the biomarker category</p>  <p> External validation  <br>   <br>External validation of the prediction models will be performed on retrospective data from the Danish national cohort. This cohort is a comprehensive collection of all the digital ECGs recorded in Denmark, and therefore highly representative of our target population. However, the Health Statistics Denmark platform only allows aggregated result collection and simple computation. For this reason, it cannot be used for training.</p>  <p> Contact  <br> Délégué·e à la protection des données Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet consectetur.
